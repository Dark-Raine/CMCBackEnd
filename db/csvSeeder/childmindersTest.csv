London SW19","Hello.

My name is Danielle and I am an Ofsted registered childminder based in Southfields/Wimbledon Park area. I have two children of my own aged 6 (boy) and 13 (girl) who are both in full time education. We live in a 3 bed house with a secure back garden not 10 minutes away from Southfields station/town centre. We have a cat named Joy who is extremely chilled and very friendly. 

My educational background is in Primary Education (teaching) and I have worked/volunteered in nurseries/my own children's school and was a nanny for a family with two girls from they were newborn for over 8years and saw becoming a childminder as an opportunity to still be involved in childcare and be around for my own children while providing a high level of learning, care, support, safeguarding and a positive, healthy environment that with the support of parents/carers will see that child blossom. I will be following the EYFS statutory standards set out by The Department of Education and using the framework set out by Ofsted to cover all areas of learning.

A day @Danielle's might involve a day at the park no matter the weather come rain or shine we will be out and about feeding the ducks at the local park (Wimbledon park), looking for books at the local library, at a children's centre or playgroup socialising, singing, dancing or whipping up lunch/cakes in the kitchen, hunting for bugs in the garden or over the common exploring. there will be outings to farms,museums and other places of interest and lots of play be it indoors, outdoors, messy or creative but always having fun.

If you have any questions or would like to arrange a visit please don't hesitate to contact me during my working hours MON-FRI 8AM TO 6PM.",80,8:00am,6.00pm,Monday - Friday
